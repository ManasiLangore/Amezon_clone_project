# 🛒 Amazon Clone  

This is my second web project — a **fully responsive Amazon Clone** built using **HTML, CSS, and JavaScript**. 🏪 This project replicates the **homepage** and some core functionalities of Amazon, helping me practice front-end development skills and UI design.  

## 📌 Features  
- 🎨 **Responsive Design** — Works on desktops, tablets, and mobile devices  
- 🔍 **Search Bar** — Simulated search functionality  
- 🛍️ **Product Listing** — Displays products in an organized layout  
- 🏷️ **Categories Section** — Navigation for different product categories  
- 📦 **Add to Cart UI** — Basic cart interface (without backend functionality)  
- 🎭 **Hover Effects & Animations** — Smooth UI interactions  

## 🎯 What I Learned  
- Advanced **CSS styling & Flexbox/Grid layouts**  
- Creating a **modern UI** similar to real-world e-commerce sites  
- Handling **DOM manipulations** using JavaScript  
- Implementing **responsive navigation bars & dropdowns**
